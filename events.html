    <h1>Here are best of our events:</h1>
    <h2>1. Laster:</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>Laster is an exciting game centered around progressing through a series of unique and challenging stages!
There are a total of six stages and two competing teams. If your team successfully completes all the stages, you’ll emerge victorious. Ho<b>w</b>ever, there’s a twist — if your team loses a stage, you’ll be forced to participate in an elimination vote where one player will be voted out. Do you have what it takes to endure and make it all the way to the end?
<br></br>
The first stage was called Push Blocks. In this challenge, teams had to work together to push five heavy blocks through a series of walls and obstacles. The first team to successfully place all their blocks onto designated pads would win the round, while the losing team would face elimination, and the player receiving the most votes would be sent home.
<br></br>
The second stage was a Parkour Challenge, where teamwork and speed were key. Every member of the team h<b>a</b>d to complete the parkour course, and the team that finished faster would claim victory. The slower team once again had to face the dreaded elimina<b>t</b>ion vote, risking the loss of one of their own.</p>
   <br></br><br></br>
   <h2>2. Trivia-Cognition</h2>
   <br></br>
   <p>Trivia Cognition was a t<b>h</b>rilling event where players had to correctly answer a series of questions in order to advance to the next one. Each participant was given three chances to answer incorrectly — after three wrong answers, they were el<b>i</b>minated from the competition. The event continued until only one player remained and claimed victory.
   <br></br>
To keep the atmosphere lively and entertaining for everyone participating, the owner of our server introduced a fun twist: "Earrape Microphones" — ultra-loud sound effects that would blast after being activated, adding an unexpected and chaotic energy to the event.</p>
   <br></br><br></br>
   <h2>3. Anniversary Event</h2>
   <br></br>
   <p>he Anniversary Event took place within the previous Trivia Cognition event, offering a hidden challenge for players to discover. During the trivia, players needed to type a specific code "hexa" into the chat to summon a mysterious portal. This portal transported them to a new area known as The Limbo Realm, where the real puzzles began to unfold.
   <br></br>
   On the first isla<b>n</b>d, players had to locate and press a single grey button hidden on a glowing neon-white landscape. After completing that, they were taken to the second island, where they needed to find two grey buttons across a similarly blinding neon surface. Once both buttons were pressed, players had to spot a code written on the ground — "Judicium" — and type it into the chat. Doing so summoned the final bridge leading out of the realm.
   <br></br>
   Crossing the bridge teleported players to an obby challenge (obstacle course), which they had to successfully complete to move forward. After conquering the obby, they arrived at another island where fragments of a code were scattered around. Players needed to search for all the pieces and correctly input the full code into a Code Pad.
   <br></br>
   Finally, for the last sta<b>g</b>e, players faced a decoding challenge: they had to interpret a Morse code message hidden within the island and use the translated words to form the final code needed to complete the event.</p>

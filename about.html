    <h1>What's Epic Chat?</h1>
	<br></br>
    <p>Epic C<b>h</b>at is a friend's group of: Srax, Astro, Mex, Rt, Notalex, Unique, Rasmus, Zepyx, Osam, Nerd, Astra & Miguel</p>
    <br></br>
	<p>We regularly host a variety of engaging events designed to entertain and bring excitement to our community members. These events often feature competitive <b>e</b>lements, and it’s not uncommon for at least one participant to express their frustration after experiencing a loss. To make the competitions even more thrilling, we offer enticing prizes such as Robux, exclusive roles, and other valuable rewards. For those who are interested in learning more about the different types of events we organize and how they work, additional information can be found on the next page.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>In addition to our exciting events, Epic Chat also offers a range of unique and immersive experiences for our members to enjoy. Among these are rich and evolving lore that adds depth and personality to our community, occasional scavenger hunts that challenge participants' w<b>i</b>t and teamwork, and even the blossoming of love stories — though, so far, only between two lucky individuals. These special elements help create a lively and unforgettable atmosphere that sets Epic Chat apart from the rest.</p>
	<br></br>
	<p>Our server is known for maintaining an overall friendly and welcoming atmosphere, where members can feel comfortable and enjoy themselves. However, like any community, occasional arguments may arise. To ensure that the environment stays positive and respectful, we have a set of rules that all members are expected to follow. If a rule is broken, a warning will be i<b>s</b>sued. The severity of the broken rule will determine the length of the time-out or disciplinary action that follows.

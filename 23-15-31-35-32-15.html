        <h2>Cat Behavior</h2>
        <p>Cats communicate through a variety of ways, using vocalizations, body language, and even scent! Here are a few common behaviors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purring:</strong> Indicates contentment, but can also occur when a cat is feeling anxious or unwell.</li>
            <li><strong>Meowing:</strong> Cats use meowing to communicate with humans, asking for food, attention, or even to express frustration.</li>
            <li><strong>Tail Movements:</strong> A cat's tail is often a reflection of its mood. A flicking tail means irritation, while a high tail indicates confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Scratching:</strong> Cats scratch to mark territory, stretch their muscles, and sharpen their claws.</li>
        </ul>
